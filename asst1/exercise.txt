1. Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the langauge of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this method suboptimal?
	The intersection is controlled by locks. Only one car is allowed to use this intersection(hold the lock) at a certain time, and other cars can use the intersection only if the intersection is free (the lock is released). This method is suboptimal because if a car do not need another car's path to pass the intersection, they actually can pass the intersection together. For example, a car from SE to NE and a car from NW to SW. 
	
2. Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this four-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection).
	For example, if four cars all enter the intersection from 4 directions, and they need each other's place to exit. And it leads to a deadlock.
