<h3>Name</h3>
crash - commit various exceptions

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
/testbin/crash [<em>operation</em>]

<h3>Description</h3>

crash will perform any one of fourteen illegal processor operations,
any one of which should get it killed without causing the whole system
to crash.
<p>

The operations are coded `a' through `n' and may be chosen on the
command line. If no operation is chosen, a menu is displayed and a
choice solicited.
<p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

Test `f', which writes into the process's own code segment, will only
cause a processor exception if you implement read-only code segments.
Since this is not required, it is not required that test `f' pass.
<p>

However, using test `f' must not under any circumstances corrupt the
code in the copy of crash on disk!

<h3>Requirements</h3>

crash uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>

crash should operate properly once the basic system call assignment is
complete.
