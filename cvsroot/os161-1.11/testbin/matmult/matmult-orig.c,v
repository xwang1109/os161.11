@/* matmult-orig.c 
 *    Test program to do matrix multiplication on large arrays.
 *
 *    Intended to stress virtual memory system.
 *
 *    This is the original CS161 matmult program. Unfortunately,
 *    because matrix multiplication is order N^2 in space and N^3 in
 *    time, when this is made large enough to be an interesting VM
 *    test, it becomes so large that it takes hours to run.
 *
 *    So you probably want to just run matmult, which has been
 *    gimmicked up to be order N^3 in space and thus have a tolerable
 *    running time. This version is provided for reference only.
 *
 *    Once the VM assignment is complete your system should be able to
 *    survive this, if you have the patience to run it.
